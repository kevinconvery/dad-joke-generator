# Dad Jokes Forever

## A "dad joke" site where users can read and add jokes. 

Eventually, this will be a site where users can modify their own jokes, including deleting them, and they will also be able to assign ratings to other people's jokes.

## Motivations

It's been a very different and often trying time during the pandemic. In everyone's lives, a bit of cheer could be used to liven their lives up. In the neighbourhood I live in, people have been putting dad jokes on public posts in an effort to generate some good-natured laughs. I'm guilty of that as well, as you can see below:

## Tech Stack

I bootstrapped this using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database to store the data. I also used Express and Node on the back-end to manage the routing and API calls.

For the styling of my components, I used the amazing [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) library to write my styling right into my components.
